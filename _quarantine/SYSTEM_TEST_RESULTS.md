# System Test Results - July 28, 2025

## Summary
- **Tests Passed**: 6/7
- **Main Issue**: sophisticated-runner is still running Rust version (Node.js deployment pending)
- **Database**: Working perfectly with 3,239 completed domains
- **Services**: Most services healthy, some endpoints returning 404

## Detailed Results

### ‚úÖ Working Services

1. **sophisticated-runner.onrender.com**
   - Health endpoint: ‚úÖ Working
   - Issue: Still running Rust version (needs Node.js redeploy)
   - Missing endpoints: /api/provider-status, /swarm/metrics (404)

2. **domain-runner.onrender.com**
   - Health endpoint: ‚úÖ Working
   - Shows 11 LLM providers configured
   - Missing endpoint: /api/provider-status (404)

3. **llmrank.io**
   - Health endpoint: ‚úÖ Working
   - /api/stats: ‚úÖ Working
   - /api/rankings: ‚úÖ Working
   - Monitoring 3,235 domains

4. **Database**
   - Connection: ‚úÖ Working
   - Domain count: 3,239 completed (no pending)
   - No recent activity (expected - all domains processed)
   - Volatility scores: 0 (needs population)

### ‚ùå Issues Found

1. **Cron Job Error**
   - Issue: Cron job trying to run non-existent auto_cache_updater.py
   - Fix: Need to manually edit crontab (crontab -e and remove the line)
   - Status: cache_updater.log removed

2. **Configuration Issues**
   - CLAUDE.md had outdated information (now fixed)
   - Only 1/11 API keys set locally (rest are on Render)

### üîß Cleanup Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Removed cache_updater.log (was full of errors)
2. ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with current system status
3. ‚úÖ Pushed all changes to GitHub
4. ‚è≥ Waiting for Node.js service to deploy

### üìä Next Steps

1. **Monitor Deployment**: Wait for sophisticated-runner to switch from Rust to Node.js
2. **Fix Cron**: Manually remove broken cron job with `crontab -e`
3. **Process Domains**: Use volatility swarm to process high-value domains
4. **Populate Volatility**: Run volatility scoring on existing domains
