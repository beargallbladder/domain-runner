# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

## The Problem
The Rust services are NOT deployed yet. HTTP 404 responses indicate Render hasn't created the services.

## ACTION REQUIRED - Do This NOW:

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (FASTEST)
**Click this link RIGHT NOW:**
ðŸ‘‰ **[DEPLOY NOW](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/beargallbladder/domain-runner)**

Then:
1. Sign in to Render (if not already)
2. Click "Create Services"
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for build

### Option 2: Manual Blueprint Deploy
1. Go to: **[Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)**
2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Blueprint"**
3. Connect repo: `beargallbladder/domain-runner`
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Blueprint file: `render-rust.yaml`
6. Click **"Apply"**

## What Will Deploy:

### Services Created:
- **domain-runner-rust-web** (Web service)
- **domain-runner-rust-worker** (Worker service)
- **domain-runner-db** (PostgreSQL database)

### Safety Features Active:
- âœ… **DB_READONLY=true** (no writes possible)
- âœ… Health endpoints configured
- âœ… Audit logging enabled

## After Deployment:

### 1. Update Database Connection
Each service needs the DATABASE_URL updated:
1. Go to service â†’ Environment tab
2. Change DATABASE_URL to your production database
3. Add LLM API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)

### 2. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check health
curl https://domain-runner-rust-web.onrender.com/healthz

# Check status (should show your real data)
curl https://domain-runner-rust-web.onrender.com/status
```

### 3. Monitor
```bash
# Run monitoring script
./monitor_deployment.sh
```

## Why 404 Right Now?

The services don't exist yet on Render. You need to:
1. **Create them** via the deploy link above
2. **Wait** for first build (5-10 min)
3. **Then** the URLs will work

## Build Times (First Deploy):
- Docker build: 2-3 minutes
- Rust compilation: 3-4 minutes
- Service startup: 1 minute
- **Total: ~8-10 minutes**

## Success Indicators:
- /healthz returns HTTP 200
- /status shows your domain count
- db_readonly: true in response
