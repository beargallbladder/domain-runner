## üí° USAGE PATTERNS

### 1. Quick Text Similarity
Use `/analyze/similarity` for comparing 2-10 texts instantly.

### 2. Content Drift Monitoring
Use `/analyze/drift` to track how content changes over time.

### 3. Automatic Grouping
Use `/analyze/clusters` to find natural groupings in your text data.

### 4. Model Performance Insights
Use `/insights/models` to understand which AI models perform best.

### 5. Domain Analysis
Use `/insights/domains` to analyze consistency across different domains.

## üö® RATE LIMITS & BEST PRACTICES

- **Batch Processing**: Use `/embed/batch` for multiple texts (up to 50)
- **Response Time**: Most operations complete in 1-5 seconds
- **Error Handling**: All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
- **JSON Format**: All responses are valid JSON (numpy bool issues fixed)

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **500 Error**: Check JSON format of request body
2. **400 Error**: Missing required fields (texts, baseline_texts, etc.)
3. **503 Error**: Embedding model loading (rare, service auto-recovers)

### Support
- **Test Suite**: Run `./test_all_layers.sh` to verify all functionality
- **Health Check**: Monitor `/health` endpoint for system status

## üéâ PRODUCTION READY!
All endpoints tested with 17,722 real responses across 21 AI models and 20 domains.
