## 🔄 Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Pre-deployment (30 minutes)
1. [ ] Create deployment branch from main
2. [ ] Run full test suite
3. [ ] Build Docker image locally
4. [ ] Verify all environment variables in Render
5. [ ] Check database connectivity
6. [ ] Backup current production database
7. [ ] Notify team of upcoming deployment

### Phase 2: Deployment (15 minutes)
1. [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
2. [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
3. [ ] Check all health endpoints
4. [ ] Verify API key authentication
5. [ ] Test rate limiting
6. [ ] Deploy to production
7. [ ] Monitor deployment logs

### Phase 3: Post-deployment Verification (30 minutes)
1. [ ] Health check endpoints responding
2. [ ] API endpoints functional
3. [ ] Database queries performing well
4. [ ] External API connections working
5. [ ] Queue processing active
6. [ ] No error spike in logs
7. [ ] Performance metrics normal
8. [ ] Run integration tests

### Phase 4: Monitoring (2 hours)
1. [ ] Monitor error rates
2. [ ] Check response times
3. [ ] Verify queue processing speed
4. [ ] Monitor memory usage
5. [ ] Check CPU utilization
6. [ ] Review security logs
7. [ ] Confirm no degradation

## 🔴 Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 2s p95
- Health check failures
- Database connection issues
- Memory usage > 90%
- Security breach detected

### Rollback Process (5 minutes)
1. [ ] Trigger Render rollback to previous version
2. [ ] Verify rollback completed
3. [ ] Run health checks
4. [ ] Confirm service recovery
5. [ ] Notify team
6. [ ] Begin root cause analysis

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. [ ] Collect error logs
2. [ ] Analyze metrics during failure
3. [ ] Create incident report
4. [ ] Schedule post-mortem
5. [ ] Update deployment procedures
