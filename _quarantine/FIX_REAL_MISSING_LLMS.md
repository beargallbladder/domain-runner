# FIX THE REAL MISSING LLMs

## PRODUCTION REALITY CHECK
Based on database analysis, here's what's ACTUALLY happening:

### ✅ WORKING PROVIDERS (8/11)
- OpenAI ✓
- Anthropic ✓ 
- DeepSeek ✓
- Mistral ✓
- Together ✓
- Google ✓
- **Cohere ✓** (WORKING! The test scripts were wrong)
- **Groq ✓** (WORKING! The test scripts were wrong)

### ❌ NOT WORKING PROVIDERS (3/11)
1. **AI21** - Has NEVER worked (0 responses in database ever)
2. **Perplexity** - Was working until July 9 (4,184 historical responses)
3. **xAI** - Was working until July 10 (300 historical responses)

## ROOT CAUSE
- Perplexity and xAI likely have expired API keys
- AI21 was never properly configured

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### 1. Get New API Keys
- **Perplexity**: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
  - Sign up/login and generate new API key
  - They may have changed their API or the key expired
  
- **xAI (Grok)**: https://console.x.ai/
  - Sign up/login and generate new API key
  - The old key stopped working July 10
  
- **AI21**: https://studio.ai21.com/account/api-keys
  - Sign up for new account
  - Generate API key
  - This provider has NEVER worked before

### 2. Update Render Environment Variables
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com

Update these services:
- sophisticated-runner
- domain-processor-v2

Add/Update these specific keys:
```
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=<new key from perplexity>
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY_2=<same or different key>
XAI_API_KEY=<new key from x.ai>
XAI_API_KEY_2=<same or different key>
AI21_API_KEY=<new key from ai21>
AI21_API_KEY_2=<same or different key>
```

### 3. Verify Implementation
The implementations already exist in tensor-synchronized-index.ts:
- queryPerplexity() ✓
- queryXAI() ✓
- queryAI21() ✓

### 4. Deploy and Test
1. Services will auto-deploy when env vars are updated
2. Run: `python3 test_production_llms.py`
3. Check the database to confirm all 11 are responding

## DON'T WASTE TIME ON
- Cohere - IT'S WORKING FINE
- Groq - IT'S WORKING FINE
- Local testing - API keys are on Render, not local

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
All 11 LLMs responding in production = Tensor integrity restored
