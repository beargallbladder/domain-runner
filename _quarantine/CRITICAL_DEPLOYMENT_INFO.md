# STOP - READ THIS FIRST

## THE PROBLEM
- **sophisticated-runner.onrender.com** = RUST SERVICE (NO DOMAIN PROCESSING)
- The TypeScript service with LLM processing IS NOT DEPLOYED

## TO FIX CRAWLING
1. Main render.yaml now includes the TypeScript sophisticated-runner service
2. Push to main branch triggers deployment
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for Render to build and deploy
4. Crawling will resume at 1000+ domains/hour with all 8 LLMs

## HOW TO CHECK WHAT'S DEPLOYED
```bash
# If you see "rust" in the response, it's the WRONG service
curl https://sophisticated-runner.onrender.com/health

# The RIGHT service will have this endpoint:
curl -X POST https://sophisticated-runner.onrender.com/process-pending-domains
```

## THE CONFUSION
- `/services/sophisticated-runner/` = TypeScript with LLM processing ✅
- `/services/sophisticated-runner-rust/` = Rust with just health endpoint ❌
- Rust service hijacked the deployment because it had its own render.yaml

## CURRENT STATUS
- Fixed main render.yaml to include TypeScript service
- Deployment should be in progress
- Once deployed, crawling resumes automatically
