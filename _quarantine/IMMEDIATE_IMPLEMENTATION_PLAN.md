  const socialReality = getSocialRealityScore(domain);
  
  const realWorldComposite = (financialReality * 0.6) + (socialReality * 0.4);
  const realityGap = Math.abs(aiPerception - realWorldComposite);
  
  return {
    aiPerception,
    realWorldComposite,
    realityGap,
    gapCategory: categorizeGap(realityGap) // "Aligned", "Overvalued", "Undervalued"
  };
}
```

## THE PITCH FOR ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS

*"Your brand has a 37-point Reality Gap. AI thinks you're worth $50B, but market reality says $35B. When AI makes investment recommendations, acquisition suggestions, or partnership decisions, this gap creates systematic bias against your company. We track this in real-time and alert you when perception diverges from reality."*

**This is the hook that gets Fortune 500 CEOs to pay attention.**
