## 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for brand perception analysis, and more particularly to a quantum-inspired mathematical framework that models brand states as quantum superpositions, calculates entanglement between brands, and predicts viral information cascades through anomaly detection in the quantum state space.

## 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Current brand perception analysis systems suffer from fundamental limitations:

1. **Binary State Representation**: Traditional systems force brands into discrete categories (positive/negative), failing to capture the simultaneous existence of multiple perception states
2. **Independent Analysis**: Brands are analyzed in isolation, missing critical correlations and co-movements
3. **Reactive Detection**: Viral events are detected after they begin, providing no advance warning
4. **Deterministic Models**: Cannot express uncertainty or ambiguity in perception states

### 2.2 Prior Art Limitations

Existing brand analysis systems use:
- Simple sentiment scoring (0-100 scales)
- Statistical averaging across models
- Time-series analysis without quantum properties
- Independent brand tracking without correlation measurement

These approaches fail to capture the fundamental quantum-like nature of brand perception in the collective AI consciousness.

## 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention introduces a revolutionary quantum-inspired mathematical framework that:

1. **Represents brands as quantum superposition states** with complex probability amplitudes
2. **Calculates von Neumann entanglement entropy** between brands to measure hidden correlations
3. **Detects quantum anomalies** that predict viral cascades 24-48 hours in advance
4. **Quantifies uncertainty** using normalized Shannon entropy in the quantum state space

## 4. DETAILED MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Quantum State Representation

#### 4.1.1 Brand State Vector

A brand's perception state is represented as a quantum state vector |ψ⟩ in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|positive⟩ + β|negative⟩ + γ|neutral⟩ + δ|emerging⟩
```

Where:
- α, β, γ, δ ∈ ℂ (complex numbers)
- Normalization constraint: |α|² + |β|² + |γ|² + |δ|² = 1

#### 4.1.2 Basis States Definition

The four orthonormal basis states represent fundamental perception categories:
- |positive⟩ = [1, 0, 0, 0]ᵀ
- |negative⟩ = [0, 1, 0, 0]ᵀ
- |neutral⟩ = [0, 0, 1, 0]ᵀ
- |emerging⟩ = [0, 0, 0, 1]ᵀ

### 4.2 Quantum State Evolution

#### 4.2.1 LLM Observation Operator

Each LLM observation applies a unitary transformation to the brand state:

```
U(θ, φ) = [
  [cos(θ/2)cos(φ/2), -sin(θ/2)cos(φ/2), -cos(θ/2)sin(φ/2), sin(θ/2)sin(φ/2)],
  [sin(θ/2)cos(φ/2), cos(θ/2)cos(φ/2), -sin(θ/2)sin(φ/2), -cos(θ/2)sin(φ/2)],
  [cos(θ/2)sin(φ/2), -sin(θ/2)sin(φ/2), cos(θ/2)cos(φ/2), -sin(θ/2)cos(φ/2)],
  [sin(θ/2)sin(φ/2), cos(θ/2)sin(φ/2), sin(θ/2)cos(φ/2), cos(θ/2)cos(φ/2)]
]
```

Where θ and φ are derived from sentiment analysis of the LLM response.

#### 4.2.2 State Update Equation

For each LLM observation Oᵢ:
```
|ψₙ₊₁⟩ = Normalize(Uᵢ(θᵢ, φᵢ)|ψₙ⟩)
```

### 4.3 Measurement and Collapse

#### 4.3.1 Probability Calculation

The probability of measuring the brand in state |s⟩ is:
```
P(s) = |⟨s|ψ⟩|² = |amplitude_s|²
```

#### 4.3.2 Quantum Measurement Postulate

Upon measurement (e.g., a market event), the state collapses:
```
|ψ⟩ → |s⟩ with probability P(s)
```

### 4.4 Entanglement Entropy Calculations

#### 4.4.1 Joint State Construction

For two brands A and B:
```
|Ψ_AB⟩ = |ψ_A⟩ ⊗ |ψ_B⟩
```

#### 4.4.2 Density Matrix

```
ρ_AB = |Ψ_AB⟩⟨Ψ_AB|
```

#### 4.4.3 Reduced Density Matrix

Partial trace over system B:
```
ρ_A = Tr_B(ρ_AB) = Σᵢ ⟨i_B|ρ_AB|i_B⟩
```

#### 4.4.4 Von Neumann Entropy

```
S(ρ_A) = -Tr(ρ_A log₂ ρ_A) = -Σᵢ λᵢ log₂ λᵢ
```

Where λᵢ are eigenvalues of ρ_A.

### 4.5 Quantum Distance Metrics

#### 4.5.1 Fidelity

Between states |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩:
```
F(ψ₁, ψ₂) = |⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩|²
```

#### 4.5.2 Quantum Distance

```
D_Q(ψ₁, ψ₂) = √(1 - F(ψ₁, ψ₂))
```

This satisfies the triangle inequality, making it a proper metric.

### 4.6 Uncertainty Quantification

#### 4.6.1 Shannon Entropy in Quantum Context

For measurement probabilities P = {p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄}:
```
H(P) = -Σᵢ pᵢ log₂ pᵢ
```

#### 4.6.2 Normalized Uncertainty

```
U = H(P) / log₂(4) ∈ [0, 1]
```

Where:
- U = 0: Complete certainty (pure state)
- U = 1: Maximum uncertainty (equal superposition)

### 4.7 Anomaly Detection

#### 4.7.1 Strong Collapse Detection

Anomaly triggered when:
```
max(P) > τ_collapse = 0.8
```

Indicates imminent state collapse to dominant perception.

#### 4.7.2 Phase Alignment Detection

Phase variance across coefficients:
```
Var(φ) = Var({arg(α), arg(β), arg(γ), arg(δ)})
```

Anomaly when Var(φ) < 0.1, indicating unusual LLM consensus.

#### 4.7.3 Entanglement Spike Detection

Sudden increase in entanglement entropy:
```
ΔS/Δt > τ_spike = 0.5/hour
```

### 4.8 Cascade Prediction Algorithm

#### 4.8.1 Cascade Probability

```
P_cascade = f(anomaly_strength, historical_cascades, entanglement_network)
```

Where:
```
f(x, h, e) = σ(w₁x + w₂h + w₃e + b)
```

σ is sigmoid function, w are learned weights.

#### 4.8.2 Time-to-Event Estimation

```
T_event = T_base × (2 - anomaly_strength)
```

Where T_base depends on anomaly type.

### 4.9 Tensor Network Optimization

#### 4.9.1 Matrix Product State Representation

For N brands:
```
|Ψ⟩ = Σ A^σ₁[1] A^σ₂[2] ... A^σₙ[N] |σ₁σ₂...σₙ⟩
```

#### 4.9.2 Efficient Contraction

Computational complexity: O(Nχ³) instead of O(4^N)

Where χ is bond dimension.
