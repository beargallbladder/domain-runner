echo "2. Services to KEEP (actively used):"

echo "   ‚úÖ llmrank.io public API"
echo "   ‚úÖ weekly-scheduler"
echo "   ‚úÖ All intelligence services (cohort, industry, etc)"

echo "5. Weekly Schedule Setup:"
echo "   - Weekly scheduler is at: https://weekly-scheduler.onrender.com"

echo "Ready to proceed? This will:"
echo "- Delete sophisticated-runner from Render dashboard"
echo "- Remove all Rust/unused code"
echo "- Set up clean production environment"
