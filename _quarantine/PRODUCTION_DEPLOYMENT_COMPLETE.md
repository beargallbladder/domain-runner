- Multi-failure tracking before alerting
- Service recovery detection
- Comprehensive health reports

#### Alert Integration
- Slack webhook notifications
- Email alerts for critical failures
- Alert cooldown to prevent spam
- Recovery notifications

### API Configuration

#### Primary Domain: llmrank.io
- Public API serving cached intelligence data
- Sub-200ms response times
- 3,235+ domains monitored
- 35+ AI models tracking

#### Processing Endpoints
- `POST /process-pending-domains` - Standard batch processing
- `POST /ultra-fast-process` - High-throughput processing
- `GET /health` - Service health and metrics
- `GET /api-keys` - API key status monitoring

### Required Environment Variables

#### Production API Keys (Configure in Render Dashboard)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY (+ _2, _3, _4 for rotation)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (+ _2 for redundancy)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (+ _2, _3 for high throughput)
MISTRAL_API_KEY (+ _2)
XAI_API_KEY (+ _2)
TOGETHER_API_KEY (+ _2, _3)
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY (+ _2)
GOOGLE_API_KEY (+ _2)
```

#### Optional Monitoring
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL - For deployment and health alerts
ALERT_EMAIL - For critical failure notifications
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Set all required API keys in Render dashboard:
```bash
# Each service will have access to necessary environment variables
# Database URL automatically injected via render.yaml fromDatabase config
```

### 2. Deploy Services
```bash
# Deploy all services
./scripts/deploy-production.sh all

# Or deploy individual services
./scripts/deploy-production.sh sophisticated-runner
./scripts/deploy-production.sh public-api
```

### 3. Validate Deployment
```bash
# Check service health
./monitoring/health-monitor.sh check

# Generate health report
./monitoring/health-monitor.sh report
```

### 4. Start Processing
```bash
# Begin domain processing
curl -X POST https://sophisticated-runner.onrender.com/process-pending-domains

# Monitor progress
curl https://sophisticated-runner.onrender.com/health
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Service URLs
- **Primary API**: https://llmrank.io
- **Processing Service**: https://sophisticated-runner.onrender.com
- **SEO Metrics**: https://seo-metrics-runner.onrender.com

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. Health endpoints returning 200 OK
2. Database connectivity status
3. API key functionality
4. Processing throughput (domains/hour)
5. Response times < 200ms for public API
6. Memory usage staying below 80%

### Troubleshooting

#### Service Not Starting
1. Check environment variables in Render dashboard
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check service logs for startup errors
4. Validate build completed successfully

#### Performance Issues
1. Monitor database connection pool utilization
2. Check API rate limiting status
3. Verify LLM provider response times
4. Review memory and CPU usage

#### Processing Stuck
1. Check domain processing queue status
2. Verify API key limits and quotas
3. Review provider-specific errors
4. Restart processing service if needed
