# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND - REPOSITORY IS PRIVATE

## THE PROBLEM (After 2 Days!)
- Repository `beargallbladder/domain-runner` is **PRIVATE**
- Render cannot access private repos without authorization
- That's why we get HTTP 404 for 2 days!

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

### Option 1: Make Repository Public (FASTEST - 30 seconds)
1. Go to: https://github.com/beargallbladder/domain-runner/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Public"
5. Confirm change
6. Then deploy: https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/beargallbladder/domain-runner

### Option 2: Connect GitHub to Render (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/account/github
2. Click "Connect GitHub Account"
3. Authorize Render
4. Grant access to `beargallbladder/domain-runner`
5. Then use: https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=blueprint

### Option 3: Deploy via Git URL with Token
1. Create GitHub token: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Check "repo" scope
3. Use URL format: `https://TOKEN@github.com/beargallbladder/domain-runner.git`
4. Add to Render as private repo

## WHY THIS HAPPENED:
- Render's deploy button needs PUBLIC repos
- Private repos require GitHub OAuth connection
- We've been trying to deploy from a URL Render can't access

## NEXT STEPS (DO THIS NOW!):
1. **Make repo public** (easiest) OR **connect GitHub to Render**
2. Click deploy link
3. Services will build in 5-10 minutes
4. Everything is ready - just needs access!

**This is why it's been 2 days with no deployment!** Fix the repo visibility and it will work immediately.
