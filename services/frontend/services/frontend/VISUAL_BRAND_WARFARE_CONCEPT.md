```

## 💥 **PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE ELEMENTS**

### **1. Visual Hierarchy**
- **Top 3**: Elevated, glowing, larger logos
- **Middle Tier**: Normal size, steady brightness  
- **Bottom Tier**: Shrinking, fading, sinking
- **Your Brand**: Highlighted with emotional indicators

### **2. "Losing Light" Metaphor**
```css
.losing-light {
  opacity: 0.6;
  filter: brightness(0.7) sepia(0.3) hue-rotate(-10deg);
  transform: translateY(10px) scale(0.9);
  animation: fade-pulse 2s infinite;
  border: 2px solid #ff4444;
}

.winning-glow {
  filter: brightness(1.3) drop-shadow(0 0 20px gold);
  transform: translateY(-5px) scale(1.1);
  animation: victory-pulse 3s infinite;
}
```

### **3. Animated Transitions**
- **Rising**: Logo moves up with golden trail
- **Falling**: Logo sinks with red particles
- **Stable**: Gentle floating animation
- **Threat**: Pulsing red border when competitors approach

## 🎮 **ENGAGEMENT MECHANICS**

### **1. Competitive Alerts**
```typescript
interface CompetitiveAlert {
  type: 'threat' | 'opportunity' | 'victory' | 'decline';
  message: string;
  visual_effect: {
    logo_treatment: 'pulse' | 'glow' | 'fade' | 'shake';
    color_scheme: 'red' | 'gold' | 'green' | 'blue';
    animation_duration: number;
  };
}

// Examples:
{
  type: 'threat',
  message: "⚠️ DigitalOcean is gaining on you in Cloud Infrastructure!",
  visual_effect: {
    logo_treatment: 'pulse',
    color_scheme: 'red',
    animation_duration: 2000
  }
}

{
  type: 'victory', 
  message: "🎉 You've overtaken Linode in Cloud Infrastructure!",
  visual_effect: {
    logo_treatment: 'glow',
    color_scheme: 'gold', 
    animation_duration: 5000
  }
}
```
