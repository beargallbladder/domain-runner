## Possible Issues:
1. **Render Auto-Deploy**: May be disabled or paused
2. **Build Failures**: Check Render dashboard for build logs
3. **Branch Issues**: Ensure deploying from main branch
4. **Service Configuration**: render.yaml might need adjustment

## Next Steps:
1. Check Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Look for sophisticated-runner service
   - Check deployment logs
   - Check if auto-deploy is enabled
   - Look for any error messages

2. Manual Deploy Option:
   - In Render dashboard, click "Manual Deploy"
   - Select latest commit

3. Service Configuration:
   - Verify service is linked to correct GitHub repo
   - Check branch is set to "main"
   - Ensure build command is correct

## Code Status:
✅ All 11 LLMs configured
✅ Code builds locally
✅ Service runs locally
✅ All fixes implemented

Just need Render to deploy!
