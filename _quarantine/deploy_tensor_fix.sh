- Added AI21_API_KEY placeholders (provider never worked before)
- Perplexity and xAI keys already in place (need new keys - old ones expired)
- Cohere and Groq are WORKING FINE (test scripts were wrong)
- Only 8/11 LLMs currently working, breaking tensor integrity

After deployment:
1. Add API keys for AI21, Perplexity, xAI in Render dashboard
2. All 11 LLMs must work for tensor synchronization"
