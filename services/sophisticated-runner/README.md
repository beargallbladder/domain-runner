# Sophisticated Runner - Parallel Service

## 🎯 Mission
Run **parallel** to the existing `raw-capture-runner` service to prove equivalence with enhanced domain coverage and modular architecture.

## 🔧 Architecture
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs alongside `raw-capture-runner` (not replacing it)
- **Shared Database**: Uses same `raw-capture-db` for direct comparison
- **Same Schema**: Identical database structure for equivalence testing
- **Enhanced Domains**: 500+ premium domains vs original 351 cohort
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Deployment ✅
- Deploy `sophisticated-runner` alongside existing service
- Both services process different domain sets in same database
- Compare performance, reliability, and results

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing
- Monitor both services running in parallel
- Validate data quality and processing consistency
- Compare domain coverage and analysis depth

### Phase 3: Migration (Future)
- Once equivalence is proven, gradually migrate traffic
- Deprecate `raw-capture-runner` when ready
- Full cutover to sophisticated architecture

## 📊 Service Comparison

| Feature | raw-capture-runner | sophisticated-runner |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Domains** | ~351 (original cohort) | 500+ (premium curated) |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic | Modular |
| **Database** | raw-capture-db | raw-capture-db (shared) |
| **Processor ID** | (default) | sophisticated_v1 |
| **Status** | Production | Parallel Testing |

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Health Checks
- **Service Status**: `GET /`
- **Processing Status**: `GET /status`

### Key Metrics
- Domain processing rate
- Error rates
- Database performance
- Memory/CPU usage

## 🌟 Premium Domain Coverage

Sophisticated runner includes 500+ premium domains across:
- AI/ML Leaders (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.)
- SaaS Platforms (Salesforce, Slack, Notion, etc.)
- Fintech (Stripe, Square, Coinbase, etc.)
- E-commerce (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)
- Development Tools (GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. **Equivalence**: Same quality results as original service
2. **Performance**: Equal or better processing speed
3. **Reliability**: Stable operation over 7+ days
4. **Coverage**: Successfully process 500+ domains
5. **Integration**: Seamless database sharing

## 🚦 Current Status

- ✅ **Architecture**: Complete modular design
- ✅ **Database**: Shared schema compatibility
- ✅ **Domains**: 500+ premium domains loaded
- 🔄 **Deployment**: Ready for parallel testing
- ⏳ **Validation**: Awaiting deployment and testing

## 🔧 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Run locally (requires DATABASE_URL)
npm start

# Deploy
./deploy.sh
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Deploy sophisticated-runner to Render
2. Monitor parallel execution with raw-capture-runner
3. Compare results and performance
4. Validate domain expansion benefits
5. Plan migration strategy based on results

This service represents the **evolution** of your domain processing architecture - maintaining backward compatibility while unlocking the full potential of 500+ premium domains and modular design.
