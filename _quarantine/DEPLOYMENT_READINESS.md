## Database Status
- **Connection**: postgresql://raw_capture_db_user:wjFesUM8ISNEvE2b4kZtRAKgGYJVtKK5@dpg-d11fqgndiees73fb35dg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/raw_capture_db
- **Pending Domains**: 3,183
- **Target Processing**: 3 prompts × 15 models = 45 API calls per domain

## What Will Be Deployed

### Modified Files
1. **render.yaml** - Updated with monitoring-dashboard service configuration

### New Services
1. **monitoring-dashboard**
   - Central monitoring hub for all services
   - Real-time health checks
   - Alert management
   - Service metrics aggregation
   - Dashboard UI at `/dashboard`

## Known Issues
1. **Uncommitted Changes**: render.yaml has been modified but not committed
2. **New Files**: monitoring-dashboard service files are untracked
3. **Domain Processing**: 3,183 domains still pending - needs sophisticated-runner endpoint implementation

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All services configured in render.yaml
- [x] Database connection verified
- [x] API keys configured for LLM providers
- [x] Health endpoints defined for all services
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Push to main branch

### Deployment Steps
1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with comprehensive message
3. Push to main: `git push origin main`
4. Monitor Render dashboard for deployment status
5. Verify health endpoints post-deployment

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all services are healthy
- [ ] Test monitoring dashboard at https://monitoring-dashboard.onrender.com
- [ ] Implement domain processing endpoint in sophisticated-runner
- [ ] Start processing 3,183 pending domains
- [ ] Monitor progress via dashboard

## Critical Next Steps
1. **Implement Domain Processing**: Add `/process-pending-domains` endpoint to sophisticated-runner
2. **Start Processing**: Begin processing 3,183 pending domains
3. **Monitor Progress**: Check domain count every 30 minutes until complete
