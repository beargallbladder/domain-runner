# Real-time Domain Processing Monitoring System

## üö® CRITICAL MISSION STATUS
**DEPLOYMENT ISSUE DETECTED**: Rust service deployed, TypeScript service with domain processing needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è MONITORING SYSTEM DEPLOYED

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

1. **Real-time Monitor** (`real-time-monitor.ts`)
   - Continuous domain processing rate monitoring (target: 1000+ domains/hour)
   - LLM API success rate tracking (target: 95%+)
   - Database connectivity monitoring
   - Real-time dashboard with progress tracking
   - Automatic alert generation for critical conditions

2. **Emergency Response System** (`emergency-response.ts`)
   - Automated issue detection and diagnosis
   - Auto-fix capabilities for stuck domains
   - Processing boost triggers for low performance
   - Database recovery procedures
   - System health assessments

3. **Deployment Monitor** (`deployment-monitor.sh`)
   - Service version detection and validation
   - Endpoint availability testing
   - Database connectivity verification
   - Deployment mismatch detection

4. **Dashboard Systems**
   - `start-dashboard.sh` - Live updating dashboard (30s intervals)
   - `auto-monitor.sh` - Continuous monitoring with automated fixes
   - `quick-check.sh` - Instant system status verification

5. **Monitoring Infrastructure**
   - Comprehensive logging system (`/monitoring/logs/`)
   - Multi-level alerting (warnings vs critical)
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Automated batch processing triggers

## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE

**PROBLEM**: Wrong service version deployed
- **Deployed**: `sophisticated-runner-rust v0.1.0`
- **Required**: `sophisticated-runner` (TypeScript) with `/process-pending-domains` endpoint

**IMPACT**: Cannot process domains - 3,183 domains remain pending

**SOLUTION REQUIRED**:
```bash
cd services/sophisticated-runner
npm run build
git add . && git commit -m "Deploy TypeScript service with domain processing"
git push origin main
```

## üìä MONITORING CAPABILITIES

### Alert Conditions
- **CRITICAL**: 
  - Service unreachable
  - Processing endpoint failing (404/500 errors)
  - Processing rate <50 domains/hour
  - Database connection failures
- **WARNING**:
  - Processing rate 50-999 domains/hour
  - API success rate 90-94%
  - Response times >25 seconds
  - Domains stuck in processing >15 minutes

### Automated Fixes
- Reset stuck domains to pending status
- Trigger rapid processing batches
- Service health recovery attempts
- Database connection retry logic

### Real-time Metrics
- Domain processing progress (current/total)
- Processing rate (domains per hour)
- Estimated completion time
- Service health status
- API response times
- Error patterns and counts

## üéØ MISSION PARAMETERS

- **Total Domains**: 3,183 pending
- **Target Rate**: 1,000+ domains/hour
- **API Success**: 95%+ for all LLM providers
- **Service Uptime**: 99%+ availability
- **Data Quality**: Zero loss, complete LLM responses

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **CRITICAL - Deploy Correct Service**:
   ```bash
   ./deployment-monitor.sh  # Verify current status
   ```

2. **Start Monitoring** (after deployment fix):
   ```bash
   ./quick-check.sh         # Quick status verification
   ./start-dashboard.sh     # Real-time dashboard
   ./auto-monitor.sh        # Continuous monitoring with auto-fix
   ```

3. **Emergency Response** (if issues detected):
   ```bash
   npx ts-node emergency-response.ts diagnose  # Full diagnostics
   npx ts-node emergency-response.ts boost     # Trigger processing boost
   npx ts-node emergency-response.ts reset-stuck # Reset stuck domains
   ```

## üìã MONITORING CHECKLIST

- [x] Real-time monitoring system deployed
- [x] Emergency response system ready
- [x] Dashboard interfaces created
- [x] Logging infrastructure setup
- [x] Alert conditions defined
- [x] Automated fix procedures implemented
- [x] Deployment validation system created
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Deploy TypeScript service with domain processing
- [ ] Verify all 3,183 domains can be accessed
- [ ] Test LLM API connectivity (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- [ ] Validate database schema for domain_responses table
- [ ] Begin continuous processing monitoring

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS

```bash
# Check deployment status
./deployment-monitor.sh

# Quick system health check  
./quick-check.sh

# Start real-time monitoring
./start-dashboard.sh

# Run emergency diagnostics
npx ts-node emergency-response.ts diagnose

# View recent logs
ls -la logs/
tail -f logs/deployment-*.log
```

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

Once proper service is deployed, monitoring will track:
- **Progress**: Domains processed / 3,183 total
- **Performance**: Processing rate vs 1,000/hour target  
- **Quality**: API success rate vs 95% target
- **Reliability**: Service uptime vs 99% target
- **Completion**: ETA for all 3,183 domains

## üéØ FINAL OBJECTIVE

**COMPLETE**: All 3,183 domains processed with real LLM analysis, stored in database, marked as completed, with continuous monitoring ensuring 1000+ domains/hour processing rate and 95%+ API success rate.

**STATUS**: MONITORING SYSTEM READY - AWAITING CORRECT SERVICE DEPLOYMENT
