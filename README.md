# Memory Oracle

> **"Will you fade, or endure?"**

The most existentially powerful interface ever built for domain intelligence. This is not analytics—this is digital mortality made visible.

## 🕯️ The Experience

When someone visits Memory Oracle, they don't just see data. They **feel their mortality**. The flickering candle reminds them that all things fade. The timer counts their precious seconds alive. The "extinction zone" shows domains breathing their last digital breath.

**This interface makes people stop scrolling and confront the question: Will I be remembered?**

### Emotional Architecture

- **Mortality Timer**: Counts every second you've been alive on the site
- **Breathing Candle**: Flickers like life itself, reminding of digital death
- **Fade Animations**: Text disappears and returns, like memory itself
- **Extinction Zone**: Shows domains at risk of being forgotten forever
- **Shadow Metaphors**: "Know your shadows, shape your light"

## 🎯 The Purpose

We measure the **shadows of digital existence** to help brands shape their **light**. Through 21,606+ AI model responses across 535+ domains, we reveal which entities will endure in an AI-driven future.

**This is consensus reality**—the collective memory of artificial minds, synthesized into memory scores that predict digital permanence.

## 📊 Real Intelligence

- **535+ Domains**: Across 8 major sectors from AI to biotech
- **21,606+ AI Responses**: Real consensus data from multiple models  
- **Live Decay Tracking**: Memory scores change in real-time
- **Extinction Analytics**: Domains at risk of digital death

## 🎨 Steve Jobs Aesthetic Meets Mortality

**Design Philosophy**: Minimal. Haunting. Purposeful.

- **Color Strategy**: Black background, strategic use of green (life), red (death), white (truth)
- **Typography**: Ultra-light weights that feel ethereal
- **Animations**: Breathing, fading, disappearing—like consciousness itself
- **White Space**: Generous, contemplative spacing that forces pause

## 💭 The Philosophy

*"In a world where AI shapes reality, we measure the shadows of digital existence to help you shape your light. Every domain tells a story of permanence or decay. The question is not whether you exist, but whether you will be remembered."*

**This is not just a website. This is a mirror that shows your digital soul.**

**Will your domain be remembered in an AI future?**

Visit **Memory Oracle** and confront your digital mortality.

# Domain Runner - AI Brand Intelligence System

## 🚀 QUICK START - TRIGGER DATA COLLECTION

**To run weekly and premium data collection:**
```bash
node trigger_weekly_premium_runs.js
```

This triggers the sophisticated-runner to process 39 domains with 15 AI models each, generating fresh brand intelligence data.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **sophisticated-runner**: Main processing service (Node.js)
- **llm-pagerank-public-api**: Public API (Python)
- **Frontend**: React app deployed on Vercel

## 📊 Data Collection

The system processes domains through 15 AI models:
- Claude Haiku, DeepSeek Chat, GPT-4o-mini, Mistral Small
- Grok Beta, Llama models, Together AI models, etc.

Each domain gets 3 prompt types:
- business_analysis
- content_strategy  
- technical_assessment
